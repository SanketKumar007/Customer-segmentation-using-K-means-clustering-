# Customer-segmentation-using-K-means-clustering-
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of business analytics, helping companies identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and other relevant attributes. This project leverages unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-Means Clustering, to classify customers into meaningful segments.

The project provides a fully interactive dashboard using Streamlit, allowing users to upload datasets, visualize distributions, and explore clusters dynamically. Various preprocessing techniques, dimensionality reduction methods, and clustering algorithms are integrated to ensure high-quality segmentation and analysis
